<p>Skipper Bar is a men’s fashion retail chain founded more than Fifty years ago as a small knitwear store in the center of Johannesburg with T-shirts, or skippers as they were better known in those days being the core of the business. A hotel bar counter was bought at an auction and formed part of the shops’ fittings hence the name Skipper Bar was born. Skipper Bar has developed from selling only T-shirts to adding imported shoes and men’s trousers, to carrying all the major brands that fit their target market, their biggest success being their ability to adapt to the trends in an ever evolving market.</p>

<p>Skipper Bar has sets the pace for the man who wants to wear the latest in classic and fashion apparel with footwear completing the look. Skipper Bar was bought by the Studio 88 Group of Companies in February 2012 and an aggressive expansion plan is in motion for the much loved Skipper Bar brand.</p>

<p>At Skipper Bar we stock only the best brands, from adidas, Nike, Converse, Puma and Levis, not to mention all the local brands from SA, including Dickies, Nikos and Marina. Brands new to our stores like ellesse Heritage and Reebok Classic, plus a whole lot more in store. We also stock our own new footwear & apparel brand “London Republic”. Skipper Bar has extended its retail market across South Africa and some of our neighboring countries in Africa, like Lesotho and soon in Namibia. With over 87 stores, and more opening soon, it not so hard to catch us in your favourite Mall or shopping Complex.</p>
